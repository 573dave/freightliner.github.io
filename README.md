# Right to Repair - Workshop Manual Viewer

## Introduction

This project provides a simple, web-based viewer for accessing workshop manuals, specifically designed to support the Right to Repair movement. The manuals are available for a variety of equipment, ensuring motor vehicle owners and independent repair facilities have the necessary resources for maintenance and repair. This initiative is in response to the growing demand for accessible repair information, aligning with legislation across several states.

## Disclaimer

The files included in this project are provided free of charge for the sole purpose of repairing your own equipment. Any misuse of these files may be a violation of local laws. Users are encouraged to familiarize themselves with their local Right to Repair legislation and use these resources responsibly.

## Legislation Overview

Right to Repair laws aim to grant vehicle owners and independent repair shops expanded access to mechanical data required for vehicle maintenance and repair. Here's a summary of current legislation in various states:

- **Colorado:** Mandates agricultural equipment manufacturers to offer necessary resources for individuals to repair their agricultural equipment.
  
- **California:** Requires manufacturers to provide diagnostic, maintenance, or repair means for products over $100 for seven years and products under $100 for three years.
  
- **New York:** Obligates manufacturers to supply consumers with parts or tools for electronic equipment manufactured and sold or used after July 1, 2023.
  
- **Massachusetts:** Features the most comprehensive Right to Repair Initiative, including access to proprietary telematics data. This has led to litigation by car makers against the state.
  
- **Minnesota:** The Digital Fair Repair Act compels manufacturers of certain electronic products to provide documentation, parts, and tools for diagnosis, maintenance, or repair to independent repair providers and product owners on fair and reasonable terms.

- **Table of Contents (TOC):** A scrollable sidebar for quick access to different sections of the manual.
- **PDF Viewer Frame:** Occupies the majority of the screen for clear and detailed viewing of manual content.
- **Hover Effects:** Enhance interactivity, highlighting selectable items within the TOC.
- **Minimalistic Design:** Focuses on content, reducing distractions and improving user concentration.
